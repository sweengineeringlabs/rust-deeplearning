## Test Cases

| TC | Test | Steps | Expected |
|----|------|-------|----------|
| TC-001 | NFR-100: SIMD-accelerated tensor operations (matmul, conv1d, element-wise) (Analysis) | _TODO_ | Comparable to single-threaded C |
| TC-002 | NFR-101: Cache-friendly memory layout (row-major, contiguous where possible) (Analysis) | _TODO_ | L1/L2 utilization > 80% |
| TC-003 | NFR-102: Buffer recycling via `TensorPool` reduces allocation pressure in backward pass (Analysis) | _TODO_ | < 10% time in alloc during training |
| TC-004 | NFR-103: Zero-copy views for reshape/transpose/slice (Analysis) | _TODO_ | No allocation for shape-only ops |
