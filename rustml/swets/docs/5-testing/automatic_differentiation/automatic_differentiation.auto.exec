## Test Cases

| TC | Test | Verifies | CI Job | Build | Status | Last Run |
|----|------|----------|--------|-------|--------|----------|
| TC-001 | FR-200: `GradientTape` records forward operations as `TapeEntry` list (Test) | REQ-001 | | | Pending | |
| TC-002 | FR-201: `TapeEntry` stores: `BackwardOp`, output ID, input IDs, saved tensors (Test) | REQ-002 | | | Pending | |
| TC-003 | FR-202: `BackwardOp` trait with `backward(grad_output, saved) -> Vec<input_grads>` (Test) | REQ-003 | | | Pending | |
| TC-004 | FR-203: `GradientTape::backward(loss_id)` replays tape in reverse, accumulates gradients in `HashMap<TensorId, Tensor>` (Test) | REQ-004 | | | Pending | |
| TC-005 | FR-204: `GradientTape::grad(id)` retrieves gradient for a tensor (Test) | REQ-005 | | | Pending | |
| TC-006 | FR-205: `GradientTape::clear()` resets ops and gradients between training steps (Test) | REQ-006 | | | Pending | |
| TC-007 | FR-206: `tape.enabled` flag to disable recording (inference mode) (Test) | REQ-007 | | | Pending | |
| TC-008 | FR-207: `Layer::forward` accepts `Option<&mut GradientTape>` — `None` means no recording (Test) | REQ-008 | | | Pending | |
| TC-009 | FR-208: Scoped `no_grad` helper that temporarily disables tape (Test) | REQ-009 | | | Pending | |
| TC-010 | FR-209: Non-tracking `_raw` variants of ops (e.g. `matmul_raw`) for use inside backward implementations (Test) | REQ-010 | | | Pending | |
